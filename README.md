The task is: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.

# Customer-Analysis
Data from an Audiobook app. It relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once. I want to create a machine learning algorithm based on the available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.

The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.

There are several variables: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).


The targets are a Boolean variable (so 0, or 1). 

The model perdict if a customer will convert in the next 6 months.
